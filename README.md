## Configuration

Copy the contents from `.env.example` to `.env` from the root directory:
```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```
Edit the `.env` file to add your:  

* **ACCESS_TOKEN:** You can generate `accessToken` using the [OAuth Playground](https://developer.intuit.com/v2/ui#/playground)
* **NGROK_ENABLED:(optional)** By default it is set to `false`. If you want to serve the Sample App over HTTPS, set the variable to `true` 
* **PORT:(optional)** Optional port number for the app to be served

** Please note, that we are testing this Sample in **Sandbox Environment**. To test in Production please use the below `.env` variables:
* TOKEN_URL=`https://sandbox.api.intuit.com/quickbooks/v4/payments/tokens`    
* CHARGE_URL=`https://sandbox.api.intuit.com/quickbooks/v4/payments/charges`



### TLS / SSL (**optional**)

If you want your enpoint to be exposed over the internet. The easiest way to do that while you are still developing your code locally is to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).  

You dont have to worry about installing ngrok. The sample application does that for you.   
1. Just set `NGROK_ENABLED` = `true` in `.env` 


## Usage

```bash
$ npm start
```

### Without ngrok (if you are using localhost i.e `NGROK_ENABLED`=`false` in `.env`)
You will see an URL as below:
```bash
ðŸ’» Server listening on port 8000  
ðŸ’³ See the Sample App in your browser: http://localhost:8000
```


### With ngrok (if you are using ngrok i.e `NGROK_ENABLED`=`true` in `.env`)

Your will see an URL as below : 
```bash
ðŸ’» Server listening on port 8000  
ðŸ’³ See the Sample App in your browser: https://9b4ee833.ngrok.io
```

Click on the URL and follow through the instructions given in the sample app.
